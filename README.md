# Uncommon HTML Error: Handling Non-Existent Elements

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in HTML/JavaScript interaction: attempting to access a DOM element that doesn't exist.  The code attempts to modify the `innerHTML` of an element that is not present in the HTML structure. 

The `bug.html` file showcases the error. The `bugSolution.html` file provides a solution using proper error handling and checks for null values. 

This is important to avoid unexpected behavior and to create more robust web applications.
